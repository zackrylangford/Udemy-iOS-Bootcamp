## Summary

* We learned how to add objects to a storyboard interface. You click on the object you want to add in the Object Library and drag it to the storyboard. You can use the Attributes Inspector to change the appearance of the object. You can use the Assistant Editor to connect the object to the code. You can use the Library to add new objects to the Object Library.

* You can right click on an object in the storyboard to see a list of connections. You can click and drag from the circle next to the connection to the code to connect the object to the code.

* We learned about appicons and how to create those in Sketch. We learned how to add those to our project.

* There is a site that automatically generates the sizes that you need for appicons. You can find that site here: [https://makeappicon.com/](https://makeappicon.com/) or https://www.appicon.co/#image-sets 

* There is also a great place for getting color palettes called colorhunt. You can find that site here: [https://colorhunt.co/](https://colorhunt.co/) or https://colorhunt.co/

* We discussed using Canva to create images for our apps. You can find that site here: [https://www.canva.com/](https://www.canva.com/) or https://www.canva.com/

## iphone resolutions

* We also discussed the different iphone resolutions and how there are 1x 2x and 3x images that are needed for the different resolutions.
