# Swift Programming Basics

### Print Statements

* Print statements are used to print output to the console.

Example:

```swift
print("Hello, world!")
```

### Concatenation

* Concatenation is used to combine strings.

Example:

```swift
print("Hello, " + "world!")
```


## Variables and Constants

### Variables

```swift
var myVariable = 42
myVariable = 50

let myConstant = 42
```

#### Storing Strings and Data in Variables

```swift
var myVariable = "Hello"
myVariable = "World"
```

#### Storing Numbers in Variables

```swift
var myVariable = 42
myVariable = 50

// You can also use underscores to make large numbers more readable:
var population = 8_000_000

//add, subtract, etc with variables
var score = 95
score = score + 5
```

### Arrays
    
    ```swift
    var shoppingList = ["catfish", "water", "tulips"]
    shoppingList[1] = "bottle of water"

    var occupations = [
        "Malcolm": "Captain",
        "Kaylee": "Mechanic",
    ]
    occupations["Jayne"] = "Public Relations"
    ```
* We did the following exercise:

```swift
func exercise() {

    let numbers = [45, 73, 195, 53]
    // ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

    //####################################
    //Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
    let computedNumbers = [(numbers[0] * numbers[1]), (numbers[1] * numbers[2]), (numbers[2] * numbers[3]), (numbers[3] * numbers[0])]



    //Write your code above this line ðŸ‘†
    //####################################

    //ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
    print(computedNumbers)

}



exercise()

```
### Explanation of the solution:
* We created a variable called computedNumbers and set it equal to an array of the computed numbers. 
* We used the numbers array and multiplied the first element by the second element, the second element by the third element, the third element by the fourth element, and the fourth element by the first element.
* We then printed the computedNumbers array.


### Randomisation
    
    ```swift
    let individualScores = [75, 43, 103, 87, 12]
    var teamScore = 0
    for score in individualScores {
        if score > 50 {
            teamScore += 3
        } else {
            teamScore += 1
        }
    }
    print(teamScore)
    ```

### random module

There are lots of ways to utilize the random module in Swift.  Here are a few examples:
    
        ```swift
        import Foundation
        // this will print a random number between 0 and 5
        let randomInt = Int.random(in: 0..<6)
        ```

Using random.element() will return a random element from an array.  Here is an example:

```swift
import Foundation
let names = ["Bob", "Sally", "Jane", "Jim"]
let randomName = names.randomElement()
```

Using random.shuffle() will shuffle the elements in an array.  Here is an example:

```swift
import Foundation
var names = ["Bob", "Sally", "Jane", "Jim"]
names.shuffle()
```


You can find the documentation for the random module here: [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/int/2995641-random](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/int/2995641-random) or https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/int/2995641-random

### Constants
 Constants are declared with the `let` keyword.
 They cannot be changed once set.
 They must be set when declared.   

    ```swift
    let myConstant = 42
    ```


### Difference between let and var

* let is a constant and var is a variable.
* let is immutable and var is mutable.
* let is used for values that will not change and var is used for values that will change.


### Responding to user interactions with IBActions and IBOutlets

* IBAction is a function that is called when a user interacts with a UI element.
* Right click and drag from the storyboard view over to the viewcontroller to set up an IBAction or IBOutlet.
* IBOutlets are used to connect UI elements to the code.
* IBActions are used to connect code to UI elements.
* IBActions are used to detect user interaction with UI elements.


### Swift Naming Conventions

* Swift uses camel case.
* Swift uses lower camel case for variables and upper camel case for types.
* Swift uses lower camel case for functions and upper camel case for protocols and enums.
* Swift uses lower camel case for properties and upper camel case for classes.
* Swift uses lower camel case for constants and upper camel case for structs.


### Commmenting in Swift

* Single line comments are created with two forward slashes.
* Multi-line comments are created with a forward slash and an asterisk and an asterisk and a forward slash.
* Comments are used to explain what the code is doing.
* Comments are used to explain why the code is doing what it is doing.
* Comments are used to explain what the code is doing.
* Comments are used to explain why the code is doing what it is doing.


example: 

```swift
// This is a single line comment

/* This is a multi-line comment */

```

A quick way to comment out a comment is to use command and / (this can be used for python as well!)




### String Interpolation

* String interpolation is used to insert variables into strings.
* String interpolation is done with a backslash and a pair of parentheses.
* You can insert bits of code into strings using string interpolation.
