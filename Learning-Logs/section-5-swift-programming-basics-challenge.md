## Arrays Exercise

# Instructions

Given the array of numbers in main.swift. Create another array called `computedNumbers`. `computedNumbers` should multiply each element in the numbers array by the next element. The last element should be multiplied by the first.

e.g. If numbers was equal to:

[3, 1, 4, 2]

`computedNumbers` should equal [3 x 1, 1 x 4, 4 x 2, 2 x 3] which is:

[3, 4, 8, 6]

Replace the comments with your code.

IMPORTANT:

1. You should not have to do the calculations yourself, it should be done by the code.

2. You are not allowed to type the numbers 45, 73, 195 or 53 in your solution code.

3. `computedNumbers` should be created as a variable named exactly as you see in the print statement. Do not change the rest of the code.



# Hint

In Swift, multiplication is done with the asterisk symbol. e.g. 3 x 4 would be:

3 * 4

## Variables Exercise

# Instructions

Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables `a` and `b` inside the main.swift file. 

**Warning.** Do not change the code on lines 1-4 and 16-20. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any value of a and b.

# Example Input 1

```
a: 5
```

```
b: 8
```

# Example Output 1

```
a: 8
```

```
b: 5
```

Your code should also work for any value. For example if `a` has the value "Hello" and `b` is "Jack" then:


# Example Input 2

```
a: "Hello"
```

```
b: "Jack"
```

# Example Output 2

```
a: "Jack"
```

```
b: "Hello"
```

# Hint

1. You should not have to type any numbers in your code. 
2. You might need to make some more variables.

We then did a magic 8 ball exercise where we generated a random number and then used that random number to select a response from an array of images which were linked to a image view in the storyboard.  We also used a button to generate a new random number and a new response.
