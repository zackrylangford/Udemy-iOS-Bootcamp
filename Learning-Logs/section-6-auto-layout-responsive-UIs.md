### Auto-Layout

### How to add constraints and understand how auto layout works.

* Key takeaways - the difference between views and stack views:

    * Views are the building blocks of your UI. They are the buttons, labels, text fields, images, and all the other objects that you add to your app. Views are the objects that you see on the screen when you run your app.
    
    * Stack views are views that contain other views. They are a way to group views together. You can use stack views to lay out your UI. You can also use stack views to group views together and then lay out the stack views. Stack views are a very powerful tool for laying out your UI. 

* Key takeaways - the difference between constraints and auto layout: 

    * Constraints are the rules that you use to lay out your UI. You use constraints to specify the position and size of views and stack views. You can also use constraints to specify the spacing between views and stack views. 

    * Auto layout is the system that implements your constraints. Auto layout is the system that takes your constraints and uses them to lay out your UI.
